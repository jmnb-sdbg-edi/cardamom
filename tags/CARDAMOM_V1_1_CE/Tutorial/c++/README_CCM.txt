Welcome to the CARDAMOM TUTORIAL Version 2.0
============================================

The purpose of CARDAMOM Tutorial is to provide comprehensive examples for writing
software based on CARDAMOM runtime middleware. Provided Makefiles may be reused
to write more sofisticated ones that suit needs of CARDAMOM users.

Note
====

This tutorial is designed to be used with Version 1.1 of Cardamom

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

To execute a Tutorial :
  execute "make" to generate executable
  > cd hello
  > make
  
  then go to "run" directory of example and type "start.sh" to run example
  > cd run
  > start.sh

  To perform deployment operations (install, building assembly etc.) deployment tool is started
  For each ccm example, the appropriate operations are listed in the following files  
  - ccm_integration_commands.txt 
  - ccm_stop_command.txt 
  located under the /run directory. 

CONTENT:

tao14-OF.mk      : ACE/TAO 1.4 configuration file
README_CCM.txt: This file
config.mk : CARDAMOM configuration file for use by tutorial Makefiles
configure.sh  : Shell script to generate site.mk file
site.mk       : Configuration file used by tutorial Makefiles (generated file)


For each tutorial subdirectory :

    Makefile      : Global Makefile
    data/         : Contains XML data files for starting tutorial programs
    idl/          : Contains 'user-provided' IDL files
    include/      : Contains 'user-provided' header files
    run/          : Contains scripts for starting tutorial programs
    src/          : Contains 'user-provided' source files
    xml/          : Contains 'user-provided' XML data files for CARDAMOM codegeneration

    The following directories are created by the global Makefile
    generated/    : Contains CARDAMOM generated files
    host-type/    : Build directory
                    => i686-pc-linux-gnu/
                       Contains .h, .hpp, .cpp generated by the idl compiler
                                .o, .so and executables




examples :

ccm010              : basic component without facet and event

ccm030              : facet inheritance
ccm040              : facet component support
ccm050              : event publisher
ccm060              : event emitter

                      (receptacle connection to naming service 
                       => CosNaming.idl include in Hello.idl file)
ccm130              : event connection
