This is the TAO Multicast Hello test, but in cardamom environnement.
The code is not changed so it is normal to have call of specific
TAO and ACE methods.
And it is also normal to keep the client.conf & server.conf files.
The aim of this test is not to test Cdmw ftmonitoring but to
check that the TAO multicast works properly in Cdmw devloppement environment
(but this test does not use any Cdmw lib)
