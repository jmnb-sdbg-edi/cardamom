	* orbsupport/c++/src/OrbTaoImpl.cpp: Replaced locking strategy for
	  POA and Profile from "null" to "thread". This should fix the
	  PCR-201.

	* commonsvcs: Added new CSC that curently contains a federation
	  framework based on CORBA MIOP.  

	  This CSC is supposed to contain all the common services that are
	  either used or extended by other CARDAMOM services.

	  In upcoming CARDAMOM releases, the data store implementation
	  as well as the naming will be moved here.


	* commonsvcs/c++/incl/UpdateProtocolHandler.hpp:
	* commonsvcs/c++/src/UpdateProtocolHandler.cpp:

	  The interface that defines the basic protocol that has to be
	  supported protocol handlers. The user of the framework can
	  define its own protocol handler so to implement different
	  distribution algorithms.

	* commonsvcs/c++/incl/SimpleMiopUpdateProtocolHandler.hpp: 
	* commonsvcs/c++/src/SimpleMiopUpdateProtocolHandler.cpp:

	  A simple protocol handler implementation based on CORBA MIOP,
	  which increase the probability of delivering an update by
	  retransmitting the same update up to N times, where N can be
	  configured by the user. 
 
	* commonsvcs/c++/incl/TopicWriter.hpp: A draft interface of a
	  DDS-like writer for the federation framework. 

	* commonsvcs/c++/incl/TopicUpdateHandler.hpp:
	* commonsvcs/c++/src/TopicUpdateHandler.cpp:

	  This interface defines the abstract protocol that has to be
	  implemented by update handlers, i.e., the handler that are
	  invoked each time the federation framework receives an update
	  for a given topic. 
	
	* commonsvcs/c++/incl/TopicEncoder.hpp: 
	* commonsvcs/c++/src/TopicEncoder.cpp:

	  This interface defines the abstract protocol that has to be
	  implemented by the encoders that have the responsibility of
	  producing an octect sequence that encapsulate a Topic.
	  

	* commonsvcs/c++/incl/MiopTopicUpdateManager_impl.hpp: 
	* commonsvcs/c++/src/MiopTopicUpdateManager_impl.cpp:

	  CORBA MIOP based implementation of the update manager. The
	  update manager takes care of phisically distribute update to the
	  member of the federation. Since this implementation is based on
	  MIOP, the delivery of message is based on multicast-IP, thus it
	  is not reliable. Notice that reliability can be added by the
	  ProtocolHanlder.

	* commonsvcs/c++/incl/LocalTopicUpdateManager.hpp: 
	* commonsvcs/c++/src/LocalTopicUpdateManager.cpp:

	  This class defines the API available locally to the application
	  for defining topic, registering handlers and distributing
	  updates.

	* commonsvcs/idl/TopicUpdateManager.idl: IDL file containing the
	  basic IDL types used by the federation framework.

	* commonsvcs/c++/data/CSCProperties.xml: Added file that contains
	  commonsvcs CSC build properties.
