Welcome to the CARDAMOM TUTORIAL Version 2.0
============================================

The purpose of CARDAMOM Tutorial, designed to be used with Version 1.1 patch level 03 or 
greater of Cardamom, is to provide comprehensive examples for writing software based on 
CARDAMOM runtime middleware. 
Provided Makefiles may be reused to write more sofisticated ones that suit needs of CARDAMOM users.

Organization
============
The tutorial is split into two main directories, one didicated for c++ examples and a second 
for java examples. Basically most examples provided in both languages are similar expect for those
the underlying Cardamom service illustrated exists only in c++; this is the case for examples that
illustrate the following services: Fault tolerance, Load Balancing and Time Service.

Within each type of examples (c++ and java) two Readme files are provided:
- README.txt that describes the way to install and run examples related to the Cardamom
  Technical Services, and gives a brief explanation of each example.
- README_CCM.txt that describes the way to install and run examples that describe the way 
  to develop CORBA Components with Cardamom. A brief explanation of each example is given.


Release Note
============
- Existing examples have been modified to take into account the integration of the fault tolerance
- Examples illustrating the following services have been added:
  - Fault Tolerance
  - Load Balancing
  - Time and Management Service
- Java examples have been updated to use JacOrb OpenFusion


Known Issues
============
1) Due an interoperability issue (marshalling) when using the event service the following
examples, under the java directory, have not been updated for Jacorb then cannot run correctly.
- ccm050 
- ccm060 
- ccm070 
- ccm130 
- ccm140
- ccm220
- ccm230
- ccm240
- ccm_philosophers
Problem related to PCR-0049

2) Some examples described in the Tutorial document are still under the demos/ directory of the
Cardamom installation. They will be moved under the Tutorial directory in the next version. 
This issue concerns the following examples:
- demo_ft 
- demo_state_transfer
- demo_ft_dcps
Problem related to ECR-0098

3) The demo_ft_dcps compile but does not run correclty. The last version of SPLICE more compliant
to the OMG DDS specification is used. The resolution of this issue is in progress.
Problem related to PCR-0359
