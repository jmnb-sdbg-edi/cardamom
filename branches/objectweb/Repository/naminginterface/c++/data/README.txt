The Name parser uses a state machine generated by smc (State machine Compiler) tool.
The state machine is declared in insFSM.sm file used to generate the two file
Cdmw_NamingInterface_NameParserFSM.hpp and Cdmw_NamingInterface_NameParserFSM.cpp.

The state machine Cdmw_NamingInterface_NameParserFSM follows the 'state' design pattern
as described in :
    Design Patterns
    Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software
    by Erich Gamma, Richard Helm, Ralph Johnson, and John Vlissides
