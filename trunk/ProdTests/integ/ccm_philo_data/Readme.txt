ccm_philo_data is data for the ccm_philo executable located previously in old integ/ccm_philo directory.
This last directory has been moved to qualif because it is a qualification test.
There is also a ccm_philo_data dir in qualif but the definitions are specific to qualification whereas this integ/ccm_philo_data is specific to integration.

At the time of this writing the integration tests can not be installed (so we could delete all integ directories including this ccm_philo_data) but i decided to keep here integ/ccm_philo_data in case we would want to run ccm_philo executable in an integration environnement (to be defined).
